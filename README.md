# DataSplice-ML-Project
This repository contains our machine learning project focused on predicting the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis. As our first ML project at DAU, Gandhinagar, it includes analysis, feature engineering, and modeling to uncover patterns that support early insights in healthcare. The project continues to evolve as we refine our models.
