# DataSplice-ML-Project
This repository contains my machine learning project focused on predicting the progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis. As my first ML project at DAU, Gandhinagar, it covers analysis, feature engineering, and modeling to uncover patterns that support early insights in healthcare. The project evolves as I refine models and learn more.
